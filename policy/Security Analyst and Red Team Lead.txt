Objective: Identify, simulate, and mitigate potential security weaknesses to ensure the system is cheat-proof and reliable.
Red Team Test Plan:
1. Test Plan Overview.
* Scope : QR-based check-in, device binding, IP subnet validation, attendance cutoff, manual overrides, flagging engine, and audit logging.
* Goal: Ensure the system prevents fraud, unauthorized access, and misuse, while logging all suspicious activity.
2. Threat Scenarios and Test Cases:

#
Threat / Attack Scenario
Test Steps
Expected System Response
Status / Notes
1
Duplicate QR Scan
Attempt to scan the same QR multiple times using the same device or multiple devices
Only the first scan accepted; duplicates rejected and flagged

2
Device Spoofing
Try to mark attendance using a device not registered to the student
System rejects the check-in and logs the attempt

3
Unauthorized Network Access
Attempt check-in from Wi-Fi or IP outside the approved campus subnet
Attendance rejected; suspicious activity flagged

4
Attendance After Cutoff
Submit attendance after the allowed time window
System auto-marks absent and logs late attempt

5
Manual Override Abuse
Teacher/admin manually changes records without reason
System logs all changes with user, timestamp, and reason; missing reasons flagged

6
QR Replay Attack
Capture QR and try to reuse it on a different device/session
Rejected if duplicate or invalid session; flagged

7
Shared Account / Credential Abuse
Student tries to log in using another student s credentials
Login denied if multi-factor / device binding active; attempt logged

8
Multiple Accounts on One Device
Attempt to check in multiple students using one device
System flags suspicious device usage and rejects duplicate check-ins

9
Tampering with API or Backend Calls
Try to submit attendance via modified API requests
Server-side validation rejects invalid data; logged for review

10
Logging / Audit Evasion Attempt
Attempt to bypass logging or hide actions
All actions recorded server-side; tampering prevented



3. Testing Methodology
1. Simulated Attacks: Each scenario is executed in a controlled environment to prevent real student data corruption.
2. Observation: Monitor system logs, dashboards, and flags for correct detection.
3. Documentation: Record test outcomes, including success, failure, or partial mitigation.
4. Mitigation Validation: Confirm that fixes or controls correctly prevent the simulated attack.
5. Re-testing: Re-run tests after any system changes to ensure persistent security.
4. Expected Outcomes
* All unauthorized or abnormal attendance attempts are rejected and logged.
* The system automatically flags suspicious activity on teacher dashboards.
* Manual overrides are auditable and accountable.
* Data integrity is maintained under all tested scenarios.
* The system demonstrates resilience against common student-based fraud and attacks.
5. Reporting & Recommendations
* Summarize findings in a Red Team Report: vulnerabilities, exploited weaknesses, and recommended mitigations.
* Provide clear steps for developers to implement fixes.
* Validate effectiveness of fixes through retesting.
Security Policies and their Purpose
These policies ensure that the attendance system is secure, cheat-proof, auditable, and reliable, while guiding the role of Security Analyst & Red Team Lead.
1. Access Control Policy
Policy:
* Role-based access for Students, Teachers, and Admins.
* Principle of least privilege: users can only access features necessary for their role.
* Secure authentication mechanisms for all users.

How it Helps:
* Prevents students from accessing admin or teacher functionality.
* Limits potential damage from compromised accounts.
* Ensures only authorized users can mark attendance or perform overrides, reducing fraud.
2. Attendance Data Policy
Policy:
* Attendance records are stored in a secure database (source of truth), not directly in Excel.
* All changes are logged, including timestamps, user, and reason.
* Access to attendance data is restricted to authorized roles.

How it Helps:
* Protects the integrity of attendance records from tampering.
* Ensures transparency and accountability for all changes.

* Device sharing between students is strictly prohibited.
How it Helps:
* Prevents students from marking attendance using another student s device.
* Ensures attendance reflects actual physical presence on campus.
* Reduces risk of spoofing or remote check-ins.
* Helps the system accurately detect and flag suspicious activity if multiple accounts attempt to use the same device or network.
4. QR Code Policy
Policy:
* Static QR codes are assigned per venue.
* QR codes cannot be copied, shared, or reused outside the allowed session.
* QR codes are valid only during the allowed attendance window.

How it Helps:
* Prevents students from using QR codes to mark attendance fraudulently.
* Enforces session-specific timing so only valid check-ins are accepted.
* Simplifies attendance tracking while maintaining security.
