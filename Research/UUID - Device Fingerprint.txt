UUID / Device Fingerprint Logic:
Recommendation 1:
•	A UUID issued once when a device visits a webpage. (Generated using Javas Script)
•	UUID stored permanently on client device (on browser cookies)
•	UUID stored on database (automated after UUID has been created use Java Script)
•	Entirely software-based (no hardware dependencies).



Simplified Daily UUID Flow:
1. Generate UUID (Server and Client):
•	On page load, generate a UUID. (One per mobile device).
2. Send UUID to Client:
•	Include it in the page response (e.g., via JSON API or embedded script or recommended ways).
3. Store UUID:
•	Store in cookies
•	UUID stored on database (automated after UUID has been created use Java Script).

How to check UUID:
•	Server-side check: Implement logic on your backend to read the cookie and verify if the UUID 	exists, this includes looking in database to see if user exists.
•	Validation: Confirm the UUID matches expected format and hasn’t expired or been tampered 	with.(Check in database)
•	Fallback: If no UUID is found, decide whether to issue a new one or block the request.
•	Security: Consider signing/encrypting the UUID or pairing it with student ID to	prevent 	spoofing.(recommend to connect it to Student ID)
Example (simplified):
•	Client: Stores uuid=1234abcd in cookies.
•	Server: On request, checks req.cookies.uuid.
•	If present → validate and continue.
•	If missing → Investigate(if existing user) / Create UUID(if new user)
